Performance Issues and Bugs:
  ☐ opening a chat context and closing the bottom sheet quickly before the chat context menu appears @low 
    breaks the bottom sheet
      - this might be some issue we want to ignore
      - since no events get called on bottom sheet
      - we have no idea what causes that to... not happen?

Alpha:
  ☐ check TODOs if any are do-able

  ☐ consuming native sign-in with google 

  ☐ write the privacy policy

  ☐ write the terms of service

Testing:
  ☐ mock and test Clipboard
    - with <ChatContext/>

UX:
  ☐ design the UI for kick voting from groups

  ☐ design a mockup for Discover view @low 

  ☐ add all used strings to i18n

  ☐ make search actually function
