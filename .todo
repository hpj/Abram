Performance Issues and Bugs:

  ☐ opening a chat context and closing the bottom sheet quickly before the chat context menu appears @low 
    breaks the bottom sheet
      - this might be some issue we want to ignore
      - since no events get called on bottom sheet
      - we have no idea what causes that to... not happen?

Alpha:
  ☐ check TODOs if ny are do-able @high

  ☐ redesign profile edits

  ☐ work on branding descriptions and motto

  - editable profile @high
    ☐ profession
    ☐ works at
    ☐ gender & sexuality

  - editable profile @low
    - heavy
      ☐ interests
      ☐ ice breakers
      ☐ age

    - datasets
      ☐ speaks
      ☐ religion
      ☐ origin

    - requires contract work
      ☐ avatar

  ☐ consuming native sign-in with google 
    ☐ region locking

  ☐ write the privacy policy

  ☐ write the terms of service

  ☐ use expo-updates (expo install expo-updates)
    ☐ expo's over-the-air updates

  ☐ test everything (high code coverage)

Testing:
  - test chat hints ice breaker button @high

  - find a way to test keyboard showing @high 

  - test all editable profile elements
    ☐ bio
    ☐ romantically

  ☐ mock and test Clipboard
    - with <ChatContext/>

  ☐ on different screen sizes
  
UI/UX:
  ☐ design the UI for kick voting from groups

  ☐ design a mockup for Sign up views

  ☐ design a mockup for Discover view

  ☐ add all used strings to i18n

  ☐ RTL Layout support
