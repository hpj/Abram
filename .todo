Performance Issues and Bugs:

  ☐ opening a chat context and closing the bottom sheet quickly before the chat context menu appears @low 
    breaks the bottom sheet
      - this might be some issue we want to ignore
      - since no events get called on bottom sheet
      - we have no idea what causes that to... not happen?

Alpha:
  ☐ work on branding descriptions and motto

  ☐ pressing back on a screen with an index above 0 returns you to screen 0 @high
