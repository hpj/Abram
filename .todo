Issues:
  ☐ opening a chat context and closing the bottom sheet quickly before the chat context menu appears @low 
    breaks the bottom sheet
      - this might be some issue we want to ignore
      - since no events get called on bottom sheet
      - we have no idea what causes that to... not happen?

Tests:
  ☐ mock and test Clipboard
    - with <ChatContext/>

  ☐ simplify profile and profile completion experience
    ☐ update starting page to be inbox again

  ☐ consuming google's email
