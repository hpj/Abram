Performance Issues and Bugs:
  ☐ opening a chat context and closing the bottom sheet quickly before the chat context menu appears @low 
    breaks the bottom sheet
      - this might be some issue we want to ignore
      - since no events get called on bottom sheet
      - we have no idea what causes that to... not happen?

Alpha:
  ☐ tests UI responsiveness on genymotion

  ☐ check TODOs if any are do-able

  ☐ work on branding descriptions and motto

  - require contract work for avatars
    ☐ the way I want to do this is by using base64
      in the avatar slot in the a database row instead of using storage pockets to host the avatars
      it's more cost-efficient and way less-messy to maintain and clear
      the question is how it will perform vs uris

  ☐ consuming native sign-in with google 
    ☐ region-lock signing up to the united states only

  ☐ write the privacy policy

  ☐ write the terms of service

  ☐ configure eas services
    - eas build
    - eas submit
    - read on updating eas build over-the-air
       since last I checked it's not fully developed
       and require expo publish with --target bare

Testing:
  ☐ mock and test Clipboard
    - with <ChatContext/>

UX:
  ☐ design the UI for kick voting from groups

  ☐ design a mockup for Discover view @low 

  ☐ add all used strings to i18n

  ☐ make search actually function
