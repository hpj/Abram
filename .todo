Performance Issues and Bugs:

  ☐ opening a chat context and closing the bottom sheet quickly before the chat context menu appears @low 
    breaks the bottom sheet
      - this might be some issue we want to ignore
      - since no events get called on bottom sheet
      - we have no idea what causes that to... not happen?

    ☐ region locking

  ☐ write the privacy policy

  ☐ write the terms of service

  ☐ use expo-updates
    ☐ expo's over-the-air updates

  ☐ test everything (high code coverage)

Testing:
  ☐ all te keyboard stuff

  - test all editable profile elements
    ☐ bio

  ☐ mock and test Clipboard
    - with <ChatContext/>
